Man may forget his Creator or hide far from his face; he may run after idols or accuse the deity of having abandoned him; yet the living and true God tirelessly calls each person to that mysterious encounter known as prayer. In prayer, the faithful God's initiative of love always comes first; our own first step is always a response. As God gradually reveals himself and reveals man to himself, prayer appears as a reciprocal call, a covenant drama. Through words and actions, this drama engages the heart. It unfolds throughout the whole history of salvation."}]}],"footnotes":{"1":{"number":1,"refs":[{"text":"⇒ Ps 8:5","link":"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PG0.HTM#WISDB.PSA.8.5"},{"text":"⇒ 8:1.","link":"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PG0.HTM#WISDB.PSA.8.1"}]},"2":{"number":2,"refs":[{"text":"Cf. ⇒ Acts 17:27.","link":"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYB.HTM#GOSP.ACT.17.27"}]}}}
